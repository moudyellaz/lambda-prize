# **λ**Prize

A competitive prize framework for the Logos ecosystem. **λ**Prize targets contributions where Logos cares about the outcome but not the path.

## Prizes

All prizes live in the [`prizes/`](prizes/) directory. Each prize is a markdown file following the `LP-XXXX` naming convention.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [LP-0000](prizes/LP-0000.md) | Template — use this as the starting point for new prizes |

### Proposing a New Prize

Prizes can currently only be proposed by Logos CCs. A separate process for sourcing ideas from the wider community is planned.

1. Copy [`prizes/LP-0000.md`](prizes/LP-0000.md) to `prizes/LP-XXXX.md`, where `XXXX` is the next available number.
2. Fill in all sections except **Prize Structure** (prize pool, revision date) — these are determined by the Logos team.
3. Open a pull request titled `LP-XXXX: <Prize Title>`.

Evaluation is first-come-first-served by default: the first submission that meets all success criteria wins. Single winner unless otherwise specified in the prize.
