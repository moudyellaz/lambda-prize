# **λ**Prize

A competitive prize framework for the Logos ecosystem. **λ**Prize targets contributions where Logos cares about the outcome but not the path.

## Prizes

All prizes live in the `[prizes/](prizes/)` directory. Each prize is a markdown file following the `LP-XXXX` naming convention.

### Proposing a New Prize

Prizes can currently only be proposed by Logos CCs. A separate process for sourcing ideas from the wider community is planned.

1. Copy `[prizes/LP-0000.md](prizes/LP-0000.md)` to `prizes/LP-XXXX.md`, where `XXXX` is the next available number.
2. Fill in all sections except **Prize Structure** (prize pool, revision date) — these are determined by the Logos team.
3. Open a pull request titled `LP-XXXX: <Prize Title>`.

Evaluation is first-come-first-served by default: the first submission that meets all success criteria wins. Single winner unless otherwise specified in the prize.

### Submitting a Solution

Solutions live in the `[solutions/](solutions/)` directory. To submit a solution:

1. Create a markdown file in `solutions/` matching the prize identifier — e.g., `solutions/LP-0001.md` for prize `LP-0001`.
2. Fill in the solution template: describe your approach, link to the repository containing the implementation, and attach any supporting materials.
3. Open a pull request titled `Solution: LP-XXXX — <Short Description>`.

If multiple solutions target the same prize, the first submission that satisfies all success criteria wins unless specified otherwise. A solution PR is timestamped by its opening date.

> **Parallel Society Launch Event**
>
> **λ**Prize launches at **Parallel Society**, a Logos-run event in Lisbon on **6–7 March 2026**, via a dedicated hackathon platform. During the event, submissions are accepted **only** through the event portal. The event follows an in-person hackathon format — submissions are subject to judging and the best solution is selected — so the rules deviate slightly from the first-come-first-served process described here.
>
> Submissions through this repository open on **8 March 2026** and follow the standard first-come-first-served process. However, Parallel Society submissions that are still being evaluated take precedence: a solution submitted here before a Parallel Society entry has been reviewed does **not** receive priority over that entry.
